UPDATE: 08.03.2021
Last Update, working with Catalina!
1. -> SLE goes to /System/Library/Extensions -> Use "Kext Utility"
2. -> Clover goes into Your EFi Partition
3. -> TouchpadScripts (Only for the included Touchpad kext in SLE folder) -> Extract anywhere and let it autostart (under users/your username, see TouchPadSS.png). Basically it is a script that changes touchpadsettings, because there is no working touchpadsetting gui xD
4. -> This Clover wont run without unlocked MSR 0xe2 (CFG unlock). If you can't mod your bios (you don't need), but you need to edit the config.plist inside clover and enable AsusAICPUPM=true. I patched my bios, you can find howtos how to do it, i think i wrote even one too in one of my repos. However, "AsusAICPUPM=true" is a work around, a patched bios is a proper way. (Maybe asus even unlocked it in meantime in the bios options). You will find out. Cheers!


This here is my old text, some of this, might be wrong at this time, but Mojave & Catalina runs fine! Dont't even expect Big Sur, at least not from me!

Cheers :-)

UX301LA Support

In this Repo is everything you need, to get OSX Capitan 10.11+ Running.

NOTE!!!: IF you have a different CPU/GPU PM me on Insanelymac! This is only for UX301LA i7-4558U Model!!!

Yosemite is Outdated, im not going to Support Yosemite anymore,<br />
since El Capitan runs almost better as on MacBookPro :-)

Before we start:<br />
		Im not going to write how you going to make OSX 10.11 Clover USB Installer...<br />
		Thats a Main Knowledge here... There are enough How-To's on web!<br />
		---> Use my Clover configuration files for the installer (its the best and simplest way)<br />
			 Just use my files for Clover Installer in this repo!<br />


HowTo:

BIOS Settings:
		Disable VT-D (If you need it for Windows, leave it enabled)<br />
		USB: Doesnt matter what you set, everything works!<br />
		SATA: Change to AHCI Mode!!!<br />
		Everything else doesn't matter, DSDT does the job :-)<br />

1. MacIASL: to compile the DSL Files to AML (Use the latest version you get, in my repo is the latest)<br />
		DSDT.aml / SSDT.aml goes inside EFI/Clover/ACPI/patched Folder<br />

2. Clover: Use latest clover you get, Check Files/Drivers64UEFI.zip, you need only this files,<br />
        You can use that Files from Clover (Updated ones) But use my HFSPlus.efi driver!<br />
        Its not available in the Clover Package! Use Aptiofix2Drv, not AptioFixDrv!<br />
        The normal AptioFixDrv doesnt support hibernate and have Problems with OSX USB Installer Sometimes!<br />
        ----> IMPORTANT: Read what i wrote into config.plist!!! <-----<br />
        
3. Install the kexts from my Package to /System/Library/Extensions,<br />
		Clover/Inject works too, but its better in SLE always!<br />
		But Place them to Clover/kexts/Other too! (Because of OSX Recovery / Installer)<br />
		Clover detects if your Kexts are inside SLE and dont inject automatically!<br />
		---> ApplePS2SmartTouchPad: This is a special version for GERMAN Users, but you can simply<br />
		change Language (Read how-to on OSXlatitude)... You can update this kext to newer versions!<br />
		But remember: This is a special Optimized version, newer versions will work, but the Touchpad is<br />
		not that perfect as on this version! (But its up to you!)<br />
		---> IntelBacklight: You can update it without problems!!<br />
		---> FakeSMC: Customized version! You can update it! But Check the info.plist inside what i changed!!<br />
		---> Apple_UX301LA: This is an injector, theres nothing to update... its my Build!<br />
		---> ACPIBatteryManager: You can update it without problems!!<br />
		---> BrcmPatchRAM2: Not included! You need this for working Bluetooth, but i dont know what card you<br />
							Going to use, so its up to you to download it!<br />
		---> ALC_282: Its my own patched kext, everything working here (Must be in SLE!!!) Injector Kext!<br />

4. HiDPI: Only for 2560x1440 Screen! Not for 1920x1080 Screen!<br />
		Copy DisplayProductID-1406 to: /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-4d10/<br />
		---> Download RetinaDisplayMenu and switch to your favorite HiDPI Mode!<br />
		
		
If anything is unclear, PM me on Insanelymac! If you have corrections/optimisations/ideas/etc... PM Me!<br />


Cheers :-)
